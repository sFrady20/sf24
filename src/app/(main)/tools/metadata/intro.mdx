## Favicon and Metadata Tool

I've created the Favicon and Metadata Tool to make it easier for you to generate the essential assets needed for your web applications. Whether you're working on a Next.js site or a Progressive Web App (PWA), this tool simplifies the process of creating all the necessary icons and metadata.

Just upload your images, and I'll handle the rest. The tool automatically formats your images into the right sizes for favicons and PWA icons, including "any" and "maskable" versions. Plus, it generates all the metadata you need, helping to enhance your website's visibility and performance.

With this tool, you can quickly and efficiently prepare your web app for a seamless user experience across all devices.
